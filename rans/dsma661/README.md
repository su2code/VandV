# 2D Airfoil: DSMA661 CASE

The results of this case have been compiled into a V&V case study on the [SU2 project website](https://su2code.github.io/vandv/dsma661/)! Please see the written study for more details on the setup of the case and the verification results. 

Python scripts in ./plot_data can be used to recreate the figures on the V&V website. These scripts take flow fields as inputs, generate .csv files with the required data, and plots the results.
